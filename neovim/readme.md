# Vim stuff

## Keymaps I set

Hopefully I keep this in sync with what's actually in my config. Not comprehensive,
just the stuff that I set custom

### Telescope

- `<leader>pf` find files
- `<leader>pb` find buffers
- `<leader>ps` find in files
- `<C-p>` find in git repos (respect gitignore)

### LSP

- `<C-p>` previous suggestions select
- `<C-n>` next suggestions select
- `<C-y>` selected suggestions confirm
- `<C-Space>` Something about suggestions complete, but I can't seem to get it working

### Fugitive

- `<leader>gs` bring up git commands. Still have to learn what this actually does
